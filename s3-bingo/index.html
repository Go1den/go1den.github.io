    <p>Changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weapons of the same type no longer show up in the same row.</li>
            <li>Play this version if you want each row on the card to have better average balance.</li>

    <h2>Older Versions</h2>
    <h2><a href="v1/">Version 1</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Release Date 10/23/2022</strong></p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Version 1 had no weapon bias in generating the cards. Any square on the board could contain any weapon, without care or consideration put into what other weapons were already in that row.</li>
        <li>Play this version if you want truly chaotic, sometimes easy, sometimes evil bingo cards.</li>
    </ul>
