    <h2>Recent News</h2>
    <p><strong>11/5/2022:</strong> Version 3 released!</p>
    <p><strong>11/5/2022:</strong> Added additional randomizer settings. You can now choose the weapon pool and whether or not repeats are allowed.</p>
    <h2>Latest Version</h2>
    <h2><a href="v3/">Version 3</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Release Date 11/11/2022</strong></p>
    <p>Changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are two different types of boards now.</li><br>
            <strong>Normal Mode:</strong> This is the most balanced version of bingo to date. The board now has multiple configurations, and each row, column, and diagonal is designed to be tightly balanced.</li>
            <br><strong>Chaos Mode:</strong> This is the most unbalanced version of bingo to date. Any weapon can appear in any square without bias or attempts to balance the board in any way!</li>
            <li>Board generation is now guaranteed and should never result in an infinite loop that will crash your browser.</li>
            <li>You can now set a seed for the weapon randomizer. By picking the same seed number, all players will experience the same weapon draw no matter what card they are on.
            <br>For example, if you are on card 123 and I am on card 456, we can both get the same randomized order of weapons if we both type the same number in the "Set My Own Seed" field.
            <br>If you both set to "All Weapons" and use the same seed, the order will be the exact same for both players.
            <br>If you both set to "Only weapons on this card" and use the same seed, the weapons themselves will be different, but their places on the board will be in the same order.
            <li>The supplied weapon box now shows the weapon count as well, which will help you distinguish times when you roll the same weapon twice in a row.</li>
            <li>Added last/next weapon buttons so you can navigate forwards and backwards.</li>
            <li>Please note older versions will not be supported going forward, so the new features in version 3 will only apply here.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Older Versions</h2>
    <h2><a href="v2/">Version 2</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Release Date 11/2/2022</strong></p>
    <p>Changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weapons of the same type no longer show up in the same row.</li>
            <li>Play this version if you want each row on the card to have better average balance.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a href="v1/">Version 1</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Release Date 10/23/2022</strong></p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Version 1 had no weapon bias in generating the cards. Any square on the board could contain any weapon, without care or consideration put into what other weapons were already in that row.</li>
        <li>Play this version if you want truly chaotic, sometimes easy, sometimes evil bingo cards.</li>
    </ul>
